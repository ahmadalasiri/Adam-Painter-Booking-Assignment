# ðŸ”§ Implementation Notes

## Architecture Decisions

### Why NestJS Without Passport?

As requested, the authentication system is built using **custom JWT guards** without Passport.js:

**Benefits**:

- Direct control over JWT verification
- Simpler dependency tree
- Custom guard implementation with `@nestjs/jwt`
- Clearer understanding of auth flow

**Implementation**:

- `JwtAuthGuard`: Validates JWT tokens from Authorization header
- `RolesGuard`: Checks user roles for protected routes
- `@CurrentUser()`: Custom decorator to extract user from request

Location: `backend/src/auth/guards/`

### Smart Painter Assignment Algorithm

**Requirement**: Assign the painter with the **most bookings** (most requested)

**Implementation** (`backend/src/booking/booking.service.ts`):

```typescript
1. Find all painters with availability covering requested time
   - Query: availability.startTime <= requestStart AND availability.endTime >= requestEnd

2. Filter out painters with conflicting bookings
   - Check for overlapping bookings during requested time
   - Remove painters who are already booked

3. Count total bookings per available painter
   - SELECT painterId, COUNT(*) FROM bookings GROUP BY painterId

4. Sort by booking count (descending)
   - Most requested painter = highest booking count

5. Tie-breaking: Use painter ID alphabetically
   - Ensures consistent selection when counts are equal
```

**Why this approach?**

- Rewards popular painters with more work
- Natural quality indicator through demand
- Customers get experienced painters
- New painters start with fewer bookings but can build reputation

### Closest Available Slot Recommendations (Bonus)

**Implementation** (`backend/src/booking/booking.service.ts`):

When no painter is available:

1. Find 3 slots **after** requested endTime (ordered by start time)
2. Find 3 slots **before** requested startTime (ordered by end time desc)
3. Return combined recommendations with painter details

**User Experience**:

- Customer sees error message
- Receives up to 6 alternative suggestions
- Can make informed decision about alternative times

### Database Schema Design

**Three main tables**:

1. **users**: Unified table for painters and customers

   - `role` field distinguishes user type
   - Single authentication flow for both roles
   - Easier to manage and scale

2. **availability**: Painter time slots

   - Foreign key to users (painters only)
   - Validation prevents overlapping slots
   - Simple time range queries

3. **bookings**: Confirmed assignments
   - Links customer + painter + time
   - Status tracking (confirmed, completed, cancelled)
   - History maintained for painter selection algorithm

**Relationships**:

- User â†’ Availability (one-to-many)
- User â†’ Bookings as Customer (one-to-many)
- User â†’ Bookings as Painter (one-to-many)

### Frontend Architecture

**Structure**:

- **Pages**: Route-level components
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements
- **Context**: Global state (Auth)
- **Services**: API communication
- **Types**: TypeScript interfaces

**Key Features**:

1. **AuthContext**: Manages authentication state

   - Persists token and user in localStorage
   - Provides hooks for login/logout
   - Automatic token attachment to requests

2. **ProtectedRoute**: Role-based route guarding

   - Redirects unauthenticated users to login
   - Enforces role restrictions (painter vs customer)

3. **API Service**: Centralized HTTP client
   - Axios interceptors for auth
   - Automatic token refresh on 401
   - Type-safe request/response

### UI/UX Design Decisions

**Color Scheme**:

- Blue/Indigo gradients: Trust and professionalism
- Green accents: Success and confirmation
- Yellow/Amber: Warnings and recommendations
- Red: Errors and validation

**Responsive Design**:

- Mobile-first approach
- Grid layouts for cards
- Stacked forms on small screens
- Touch-friendly button sizes

**User Feedback**:

- Loading states during API calls
- Success messages (green)
- Error messages (red)
- Recommendations (yellow)
- Disabled buttons during submission

### Time Handling

**Backend**:

- Stores all times as PostgreSQL `timestamp` type
- ISO 8601 format in API requests/responses
- Server-side validation of time ranges

**Frontend**:

- HTML5 `datetime-local` inputs
- date-fns for formatting display
- Timezone handling through browser

### Security Measures

1. **Password Security**:

   - bcrypt hashing (10 rounds)
   - Passwords never logged or exposed
   - Minimum length validation

2. **JWT Security**:

   - Configurable expiration (default 7 days)
   - Secret key from environment
   - Signed tokens prevent tampering

3. **API Security**:

   - CORS configured for specific origins
   - Input validation with class-validator
   - Role-based access control
   - SQL injection prevention (Drizzle ORM)

4. **Frontend Security**:
   - XSS prevention (React escaping)
   - Secure token storage
   - Automatic logout on token expiration

### Validation Rules

**Availability**:

- startTime must be before endTime
- Cannot overlap with existing availability
- Must be painter role

**Booking**:

- startTime must be before endTime
- Must fit within painter availability
- Painter must not have conflicting booking
- Must be customer role

**Authentication**:

- Email format validation
- Password minimum 6 characters
- Name minimum 2 characters
- Role must be 'painter' or 'customer'

### Performance Considerations

**Database Queries**:

- Indexed foreign keys for fast lookups
- Efficient time range queries
- Minimal N+1 query issues (using Drizzle relations)

**Frontend**:

- Code splitting with React.lazy (not implemented but recommended)
- Vite's fast build and HMR
- Minimal bundle size

**Scalability**:

- Stateless API (JWT tokens)
- Database connection pooling
- Horizontal scaling possible

## Testing Strategy

**Recommended Tests** (not implemented but suggested):

### Backend

- Unit tests for services
- Integration tests for controllers
- E2E tests for critical flows
- Database transaction tests

### Frontend

- Component tests (React Testing Library)
- Integration tests (user flows)
- E2E tests (Playwright/Cypress)

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term

1. **Email notifications**: Notify painters of new bookings
2. **Booking cancellation**: Allow users to cancel bookings
3. **Painter profiles**: Add bio, ratings, photos
4. **Calendar view**: Visual availability calendar
5. **Time zones**: Explicit timezone handling

### Medium-term

1. **Payment integration**: Handle payments for services
2. **Reviews & ratings**: Customer feedback system
3. **Multiple service types**: Different painting services
4. **Booking history**: Analytics and reports
5. **Admin panel**: System management

### Long-term

1. **Mobile apps**: React Native implementation
2. **Real-time updates**: WebSocket for live notifications
3. **AI recommendations**: ML-based painter suggestions
4. **Geographic search**: Location-based painter search
5. **Multi-tenancy**: Support multiple businesses

## Known Limitations

1. **No pagination**: Lists could grow large
2. **No search/filter**: Hard to find specific bookings
3. **No timezone handling**: Assumes local timezone
4. **No file uploads**: No painter photos/portfolios
5. **No booking editing**: Can't modify existing bookings
6. **No overlap detection**: Customer can book multiple overlapping slots
7. **No notification system**: Users must check dashboard

## Development Experience

### Backend Hot Reload

- NestJS watches files and auto-recompiles
- Fast iteration on business logic

### Frontend Hot Reload

- Vite's instant HMR

- Shared types reduce errors
- IDE autocomplete support

## Deployment Considerations

### Backend

- Build: `npm run build`

- Output: `dist/` folder
- Serve: Any static file server (Netlify, Vercel, Nginx)
- Env: Set VITE_API_URL to production backend

### Docker (Recommended)

- Containerize backend and frontend
- PostgreSQL in separate container
- docker-compose for orchestration
